## About the project 
This app was built for my training validation. The idea came from a need to keep organized and easily accessible the resources we shared on the course topics. 

### Context
In order to validate my training I had to fullfil all the technical requierments ordered by language bellow:

 - Configure composer to comply with the PSR-4 standards
 - Create a customised framework 
#### SQL
 - Tailor-made ORM
 - At least one complete CRUD
 - Minimum 4 tables with use of joints
 - Prepared requests and secured password storage
 - Create complex requests (transactions/imbricated requests, grouping or calculating columns)
#### Javascript
 - DOM manipulation without plugin
 - AJAX
 - the whole website must be accessible if scripts are disallowed
 - use npm and configure a module bundler
#### CSS
 - No use of css frameworks
 - Target elements with complex selectors 
 - Use relative mesurements to maximize accessibility
 - Generate animations/transitions and gradients
 - Use of flex and/or grid display
 - Readable code organized according to html order
